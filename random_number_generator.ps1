This script will generate random numbers from a given range without picking the same number twice.
Microsoft Bing Copilot AI chat helped generate this script.
Steven helped edit it.

In this script:
$Minimum and $Maximum represent the lower and upper bounds of the desired range.
We create an array of numbers using the range operator (..).
The Get-Random cmdlet shuffles the array to ensure non-repeating random numbers.
Finally, the shuffled numbers are displayed. Feel free to adjust the range as needed! ðŸ˜Š

# Define the range (inclusive)
#$Minimum = 1
#Maximum = 10
