This script will help with figuring out Singspiration dates which usually take place on the 5th Sunday night at 6p in a given month.

You may need to figure out how many days are in each month in addition to counting the number of Sundays in each month.
You need to figure out if Easter takes place the same time as Singspiration so you can skip the Singspiration.
Is there a way to get all the Easter dates from somewhere or just load them in manually?
https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/determining-easter-date.html
We've only had 1 Singspiration in December in 2013 so we may just skip Singspiration in December because of Christmas & New Years.

Count the number of weeks for any given service until the next Singspiration.
Count the number of weeks remaining to signup for the next Singspiration.

Remember, you need approximately 2 weeks to comfortability process everything before Singspiration::
sa - can signup for current event
sp - can signup for next event
wp - can signup for next event
sa - can signup for next event
sp - can signup for next event
wp - can signup for next event
sa - can signup for next event
sp - event takes place

Might borrow code that gets church services for next year.

This script's efficiency can be improved since some code is duplicated.

Having some challenges progressing in this script.
Making a note of what I know so far to help progress::
Future year.
Last Sunday of every month.
Last Wednesday of every month.
Each Singspiration date.

Use math to subtract.

Need to incorporate "PreviousYear" & "YearAfter" into loops for reporting.

# Then you'll have to work on a report for every Sunday morning, Sunday evening, & Wednesday evening so you know how many Sundays/Wednesdays are left to sign up for the next upcoming Singspiration; calculating in the lead time you need to coordinate everything.
# You may need to calculate the first Singspiration 2 years from now too so you can get the number of Sundays/Wednesdays left to sign up after the last one next year. Ok, I think I've completed this line in the code below.

<#
Remember, you need approximately 2 weeks to comfortability process everything before Singspiration::
$var - 14 days = sa - can signup for current event
$var - 14 days = sp - can signup for next event
$var - 11 days = wp - can signup for next event
$var - 07 days = sa - can signup for next event
$var - 07 days = sp - can signup for next event
$var - 04 days = wp - can signup for next event
$var - 00 days = sa - can signup for next event
$var = sp - event takes place - can signup for next event
