This script will help with figuring out Singspiration dates which usually take place on the 5th Sunday night at 6p in a given month.

You may need to figure out how many days are in each month in addition to counting the number of Sundays in each month.
You need to figure out if Easter takes place the same time as Singspiration so you can skip the Singspiration.
Is there a way to get all the Easter dates from somewhere or just load them in manually?

We've only had 1 Singspiration in December in 2013 so we may just skip Singspiration in December because of Christmas & New Years.

Count the number of weeks for any given service until the next Singspiration.
Count the number of weeks remaining to signup for the next Singspiration.

Remember, you need approximately 2 weeks to comfortability process everything before Singspiration::
sa - can signup for current event
sp - can signup for next event
wp - can signup for next event
sa - can signup for next event
sp - can signup for next event
wp - can signup for next event
sa - can signup for next event
sp - event takes place

Might borrow code that gets church services for next year.
